## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository contains multiple experiment demos, each showcasing different aspects of stepper motor control:

| Folder Name                           | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Demo_A_0.1_manual_stepMode_&_RPM`    | Allows **manual control** of RPM and step modes to observe the motor‚Äôs behavior in real-time.   |
| `Demo_B_0.1_stepMode_Iteration`       | Iterates through step modes automatically after completing a full revolution at a set RPM.      |
| `Demo_C_0.1_incremental_RPM`          | Enables **manual step mode selection** while incrementally adjusting RPM after a user-defined cycle time. |

## üöÄ Purpose of the Project

- üìö **Learning Tool**: Designed for students to understand stepper motors through hands-on experiments.
- üîç **Experiment Goals**:
   1. Analyze stepper motor behaviors at different step modes (Full, Half, etc.).
   2. Explore the effect of RPM and step delay adjustments.
   3. Measure and compare vibrations using piezo sensors and oscilloscopes. for varying settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup & Requirements

1. **Hardware**:
   - Stepper motor (compatible with Arduino Micro).
   - Arduino Micro board.
   - Power supply and jumper wires.
   - Optional: Piezo sensors, oscilloscope, or audio logging tools for vibration analysis.

2. **Software**:
   - Arduino IDE (or any other compatible IDE).

## üìä Expected Outputs

### **Demo A: Manual Step Mode and RPM**
- User sets the RPM and step mode manually.
- The motor runs at the specified settings, and the user can observe changes.

### **Demo B: Step Mode Iteration**
- The motor runs at a fixed RPM but iterates through all step modes after completing one revolution.
- Differences in motor sound and performance are noticeable at each step mode.

### **Demo C: Incremental RPM**
- RPM increments by a user-defined value after a specified cycle time. Thus, accelerating or decelerating incrementally.
- Step mode remains manually selectable.

### **Vibration Analysis (Future Addition)**:
- Vibrations can be measured using piezo sensors and analyzed via:
  - Oscilloscope
  - Audio recording software
  - Or dedicated data-logging tools

## ‚úÖ To-Do List

- [x] **Demo_A**: Manual control of RPM and step mode.
- [x] **Demo_B**: Iterates through step modes automatically after a full revolution.
- [x] **Demo_C**: Incrementally adjusts RPM after a user-defined cycle time while maintaining manual step mode selection.
- [ ] **Demo_D**: Adds incremental step delay functionality for finer control over motor speed.
- [ ] **Demo_E**: Implements smoother motor transitions by switching step modes during RPM changes.
- [ ] **Add hardware instructions** Arduino circuit board
- [ ] **Add stepper motor theory sources and more** How a stepper motor works. Defining terminology.
- [ ] **Add vibration measurement method** 
- [ ] **Introduce stepper motor libraries for Arduino** for enhanced motor control functionality.

### Demo_D_Incremental_stepDelay ###      
  - Allows fine control of motor speed changes by letting users set the **step delay** incrementally rather than the RPM.
  - Step mode remains manually selectable.
### Demo_E_smoothing_the_motor ###
  - Switches to different step modes at user-defined points as RPM changes, improving motor control.
